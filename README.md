## How the orca is rendered
The orca is made up of 44 images found within `public/orca/`. Each image is numbered like `1.png` - `44.png` from nose to tail and represents a "layer" of the orca that you see.

The application renders these images starting from `44.png` to `1.png` onto a [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and together they form the orca you see.

To make the orca move the application tracks the last 44 mouse positions, determines how far each layer should move toward the mouse, and re-renders the screen using [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).
